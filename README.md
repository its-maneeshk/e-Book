# e-Book - a web application
# Project Description:
This project is a web application for an eBook platform built using Django. It provides users with access to a collection of eBooks categorized by genre, allowing them to read summaries and explore available titles. Users can register, log in, and view books, with plans to implement features for reading full eBooks and interacting with the community. The application is designed with a responsive layout and includes features such as user authentication, dynamic content loading, and a clean user interface.
